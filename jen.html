<P>
<A href="/poem.html"><i>Poem for Jen</i></a> was originally published under 
the name Jeniffer Garner as <i>Beef Stew</i>.  In fact, she submitted it to
 her English class as her own work, with my permission.  That's why I wrote 
the poem.
I liked it, she liked it, and her class loved it.  She won 3 awards at
her school with it.  Boy that amuses me.
<P>
So anyway, this is just sort of a "I didn't steal it, she didn't steal it,
I wrote it, she published it under her name, and now it's back under my name"
kind of disclaimer.  Enjoy.
