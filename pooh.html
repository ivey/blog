<i><h1>Quotes</h1>

<blockquote>"When you wake up in the morning, Pooh," said Piglet at last,
"what's the first thing you say to yourself?"
<p>
"What's for breakfast? said Pooh. "What do <i>you</i> say, Piglet?"
<p>
"I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting <i>today</i>?" said Piglet.
<p>
Pooh nodded thoughtfully.
<p>
"It's the same thing," he said.

<blockquote>Through working in harmony with life's circumstances,
Taoist understanding changes what others may percieve as negative into
something positive.
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>When you discard arrogance, complexity, and a few other things that
get in the way, sooner or later you will discover that simple, childlike, and
mysterious secret known to those of the Uncarved Block: Life is Fun.
</blockquote>
<hr><blockquote>The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>A well-frog cannot imagine the ocean, nor can a summer insect
conceive of ice.  How then can a scholar understand the Tao?  He is
restricted by his own learning.</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>"Lots of people talk to animals," said Pooh.<p>
"Not that many <i>listen</i> though."<p>

"That's the problem."</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>You'd be surprised how many people violate this simple principle
every day of their lives and try to fit square pegs into round holes,
ignoring the clear reality that Thinsg Are As They Are.
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>Everything has its own place and function.  That applies to people,
although many don't seem to realize it, stuck as they are in the wrong job,
the wrong marriage, or the wrong house.  When you know and respect your
Inner Nature, you know where you belong.  You also know where you don't
belong.
