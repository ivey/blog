<h1>Have you seen this Bunny?</h1>

<p><a href="http://ellieivey.com">Ellie</a> has developed an attachment to Flat
Bunny.  Honestly, I expected it to be Flat Baby, and Emily of course
was counting on Night Night, but you can't pick what the kid will
fixate on.</p>

<p>So, just to be on the safe side, we'd like to get a backup. Not that
we have any plans for swapping Flat Bunny with an imposter...but stuff
happens, and if she's going to need something to get to sleep, I need
to make sure I have a Plan B.  And maybe a Plan C.</p>

<p>Flat Bunny was a gift from a knitter friend of Emily's. We're trying
to track down the origins through her, but if any of you have a lead
on any details about this bunny, please let me know.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of Flat Bunny, with a 3x5 index card for scale.</p>
