So I'm thinking about blogging again. I do this every year or so, I
know, usually when it's time to update the copyright in my footer.

A lot has happened since my last post: I left Twitpay, worked at a
social gaming company for a while, have had at least 4 foster dogs,
learned a few new programming langauges, and started a new
company. Some of those things I've talked about on Twitter, and some I
can't or don't want to talk about in any more detail, and one of those
will be much more public soon.

I'm still as active on Twitter as I was a year and a half ago, and I
still think it's the best place to communicate, discover, and be
amused. I've also spent time on a few photo sites. I'm really loving
<a href="http://mlkshk.com">mlkshk</a>, so much so that I got a paid
account. You can see <a href="http://mlkshk.com/popular">what's
popular right now</a> and learn a lot about the type of site and
community it's becoming.

We'll see if this pass at blogging sticks. If not,
<a href="/contact">you know where to find me</a>.
