title: Rails 1.2.3 eTag patch
layout: post
---
"Rails Edge changeset 6158":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6158 added automatic eTag support.  I needed it in a Rails 1.2.3 project, so I made a little patch to shoehorn 6158 into 1.2.3.

"Here's the patch, ":http://gweezlebur.com/assets/2007/7/9/patch_etag_support.rb just drop it into lib and require it.

*Updated*: includes "7580":http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/7580 too.

*Updated again:* I'm having some issues with this, so looks like I blogged it pre-maturely.
