title: Why I Won't Be Eating a Dozen Krispy Kremes Today
---

Tuesday night, in a discussion with Don, Jennifer, Shalini and Brad, I
made the statement that I did not believe it would be that challenging
to eat a dozen hot Krispy Kremes in a single sitting.

I stand by that assertion.

However, I will not be making any attempt to prove that I can do
this. One dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts contains 2400 calories and 144g
of fat.  While I believe it would not be difficult to consume this
much, that doesn't mean it's a good idea. There are many things that I
could do, and might even enjoy doing, that I do not do, because they're
not healthy or in my best interests.

If, in the future, I feel a desire to eat a dozen Krispy Kremes, I'll
document the experience.
