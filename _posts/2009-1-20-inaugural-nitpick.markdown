title: Biden was never the President

In case you're one of the people who believe that Joen Biden was
President for a few minutes between 12:00 and when Obama took the
oath of office: you're wrong.

Obama became President at 12:00, even without being sworn in. He
was not allowed to ["enter on the Execution of his Office"][A2S1]
until he was sworn in, but he was the President.

Don't believe me?  Look at CNN, they got it right:

Several minutes apart.

Still don't believe me?  Google "David Rice Atchison" and get back to me.
