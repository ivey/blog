title: How I use Foursquare

There's been a little discussion around my Twitter circle about how or
why Foursquare is useful. (I'm glad [I'm not the only one][hillimire]
who sees the irony of using Twitter to ask that question, since the
exact same thing was - and still is - asked about Twitter.)

I think Foursquare is fun, and has a decent chance of being a
long-term player in the location game. Of course I thought that about
Dodgeball, too. For the benefit of the Foursquare doubters, here's my
tips on how to use it "right". YMMV.

1. **Be somewhere with other players**  
Foursquare is only fun with other people. If you're the only one
checking in near you, you'll get bored. So unless you're a real early
adopter, wait until Foursquare has traction in your city. I live in a
town that has very little activity, but I travel to Atlanta a lot;
Foursquare is much more fun when I'm there.

2. **Have some friends**  
Not only do you need people near you playing, you need to be friends
with some of them. Real friends. Friends you'd share your cell number
with. Friends you would enjoy having drop by your table when you're at
the same restaurant. Friends you'd like to fight for control of the
neighborhood coffee shop.

3. **Don't have too many friends**  
Don't add everyone from Twitter and Facebook. Be selective. I have
maybe 20 Foursquare friends, and all but one are people I know in
person.

4. **Don't automatically post every checkin to Twitter**  
The whole point of Foursquare having a separate set of friends is that
you can limit who you share your location with. If you post every
update to Twitter, you're not only oversharing to your followers, but
you lose that intimacy.

5. **Post selective updates to Twitter**  
You can always choose to post a check-in to Twitter on an individual
basis, like if you're at a cool restaurant you've never been to
before, or at a conference. The advantage over just tweeting about it
is a 4sq link that includes tips from other people, Yelp links, a map,
phone numbers...much more info than just a geocoded location.

6. **Play the game**  
Foursquare's game mechanics are fun. Enjoy them. Battle it out for
control of the taco stand. Stake your claim at every doughnut shop
within 25 miles.

7. **Discover new places, find your friends**  
On the rare occasion that I find myself in a city where I have
Foursqaure friends, no plans, and the time and energy for some, I'll
pull up Foursquare and see if anyone is already out and about. If they
are, I may join them, or at least click a button to send a SMS or a
tweet and see what's going on.

That's how I use Foursquare. I get a reasonable amount of pleasure
from it. It's amusing, and sometimes helps me find something to
do. The best way to "get" Foursquare is to try it for a while.
