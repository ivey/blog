title: Thanks for the Retweets

Lately I've been seeing a handful of tweets per day that say something like,
"Thanks to @soandso, @friend, @someoneelse for the retweets today!" and ...
it doesn't feel right, to me.

I get it. Twitter's about social, and connections, and all that jazz. If
someone retweets something you said, they're lending you a little bit of their
credibility. That's a nice thing to do, and it's worth thanking them for it,
especially if it's something you'd really like to get out there.

If it was a DM, or a reply to that one person, I wouldn't notice. (I might
not even see it.) Which is why people use the more public list of thank-yous,
of course.

Somehow, though, it seems like it's less about a genuine thank-you, and more
of the self-promotion feedback loop we see over and over again on Twitter.
What do you think? Am I being cynical and reading it wrong?
