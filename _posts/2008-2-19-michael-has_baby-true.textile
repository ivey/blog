The title of this post (which is "michael.has_baby? => true" despite what the CSS has done to it, and that I am too tired to fix) may be the only Ruby content around here for a little while.  I mean, how can you think about Merb or HTTP headers or how much GitHub rocks when you're looking at this adorable face?
