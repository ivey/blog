$ sake -T http://merbivore.com/merb-dev.sake

sake merb:update         # Update your local Merb repositories.  Run from
 inside the top-level merb directory.
sake merb:gems:wipe      # Uninstall all RubyGems related to Merb
sake merb:gems:refresh   # Pull fresh copies of Merb and refresh all the
 gems
sake merb:install:core   # Install merb-core
sake merb:install:more   # Install merb-more
sake merb:install        # Install merb-core and merb-more
sake merb:sake:refresh   # Remove and reinstall Merb sake recipes
{% endhighlight %}
