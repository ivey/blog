It's official: we're having a BarCamp in South Alabama.
[BarCamp Mobile][] will be held March 20-21 at the
[University of South Alabama][]. Main conference is Saturday,
with dinner and social gathering for anyone in town Friday night.

**Please Note:** This is a [BarCamp][] in Mobile, AL. That's
"mo-beel".  Not "mo-buhl", as in mobile technology. "Mo-beel" as in
"Port Of Mobile" or "Mobile Bay". Think azaleas, sweet tea, and
oysters on the half shell. There may or may not be mobile developers
talking about mobile development, but it will definitely be in
Mobile. Got it?

Never been to a [BarCamp][] before? Wondering what it is?

It's an unconference. There isn't a separation between speakers and
participants. Every participant is a speaker, every speaker is a
participant. We'll develop the agenda on the wiki, on Friday night,
and on Saturday morning.

If you're coming, be prepared to present about something you think is
cool: BarCamp is as good as the participants make it. This isn't a
typical conference where you listen to people talk all day. Sessions
will be interactive, so plan to ask questions, chime in, and generally
share as much information as you have.

Oh, and it's a lot of fun. I met some really cool people at BarCamp
Atlanta two years ago, and again at BarCamp Atlanta II last year.
