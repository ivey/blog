I love Twitter lists. Really. I think they're one of the most important features
Twitter has rolled out in the past year, even more than geotweets.

First off, I think they'll slowly be the end of Follow Friday. Why plug people
one day a week when you can have a list of people you suggest all the time?
Even better, you can have multiple lists, organized by topic.

More importantly, though, lists mean I can have multiple timelines. I have my
main timeline of people I follow all the time. When they say something, I want
to see it. (I haven't completely cleaned up my following list yet, but I dropped
more than 100 people when I started using lists.) There are a lot of the people who
are funny, but I don't need to see every tweet from them. They're on my
[@ivey/funny-people](http://twitter.com/ivey/funny-people) list, and I read them when
I have time.

The problem is, not only do I have my list of funny people, but I also follow
a few other people's lists of funny people, like
[@Favstar/rising-stars](http://twitter.com/Favstar/rising-stars) and
[@Favstar/top-50-funny](http://twitter.com/Favstar/top-50-funny). There's a lot
of overlap between these lists, which means I see the same tweets 2 or 3 times.
That bugs me.

So I fixed it. First, I made a little library called, creatively,
[twitter-lists](http://github.com/ivey/twitter-lists). It uses the twitter
gem to do some set-based operations on Twitter lists, mainly Union and
Intersection. It's not fully fleshed out yet, but it's usable. Patches welcome.

Then, I made an app that uses it: [Moralist](http://moralist.gweezlebur.com).
Moralist makes it easy to combine lists in interesting ways. I'm using it to
merge 
[@Favstar/rising-stars](http://twitter.com/Favstar/rising-stars),
[@Favstar/top-50-funny](http://twitter.com/Favstar/top-50-funny), and
[@ivey/funny-people](http://twitter.com/ivey/funny-people) into a single list,
[@ivey/hah](http://twitter.com/ivey/funny-hah). This is the list I read when
I have a few minutes and need a chuckle (although [Favstar's](http://favstar.fm)
Favit iPhone app is replacing it, but that's another story.)

Anyway, try it out. It refreshes once a day, it crashes sometimes, and it
comes with no warranty. If people find it useful, I might bump it up to a paid
Heroku plan, but for now it meets my needs so I'm leaving it alone.

PS: here's a snippet from Moralist to make a twitter-auth app able
to use the twitter gem using the same set of keys:
